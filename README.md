CSS Halloween Game Jam 2021 Submission: file is name tree due to time constraint during jam - but a name was never settled on within the timeframe.

## Project Description

Bristol Computer Science Society's annual game jam event: Took part in a 24hr game jam event hosted by the Bristol CSS where I developed a Halloween themed endless runner shooter game. Written in lua as part of the PICO-8 fantasy console. The time pressure nature of the event allowed me to practice working to a tight deadline and gave me an insight into the need to prioritise features for a timed release. The PICO-8 environment is intentionally limited to replicate an old games console with tight limitations like a fixed 32k data capacity, so working on it was an exciting challenge.
